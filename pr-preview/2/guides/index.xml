&lt;p>Bothell&amp;rsquo;s downtown transformation is one of the Puget Sound region&amp;rsquo;s most ambitious suburban-to-urban revitalization stories. Beginning in 2010, the city invested over &lt;a href="https://www.bothellwa.gov/323/Downtown-Subarea-Plan-Regulations">$150 million in public infrastructure&lt;/a> to move a state highway, rebuild its Main Street, and create the conditions for a walkable mixed-use center where strip malls and auto-oriented businesses once stood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Downtown Bothell today bears little resemblance to what it looked like in the mid-2000s. Where SR 522 once bisected the city center, a &lt;a href="https://www.bothellwa.gov/1306/Main-Street-Enhancement-Project-Facts">curbless Main Street&lt;/a> now hosts outdoor dining, movable bollards, and flex zones that can close to traffic for community events. Mixed-use buildings line Bothell Way NE, bringing over 1,000 housing units and ground-floor retail to what was previously low-density commercial land.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
