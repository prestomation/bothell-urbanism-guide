# Guide Ideas

High-level descriptions of potential in-depth guides for the Bothell Urbanism Guide. Each guide would follow the standard structure: current state, history, city management, data sources, key statistics, and related resources.

## Transit

### Stride BRT & Regional Transit
The most significant transit investment in Bothell's history. Cover the Stride S3 (SR 522) and S2 (I-405) lines, the $274M Canyon Park bus base, connections to Link light rail at Shoreline South/148th, and how Sound Transit's regional network reshapes Bothell's role in the Puget Sound transit map. Include the Swift Green Line extension timeline, Community Transit and King County Metro local bus service, and how three separate transit agencies serve different parts of the city.

### Swift Green Line & Community Transit
A focused look at Community Transit's BRT service in the Snohomish County portion of Bothell. Cover the existing Swift Green Line (Canyon Park to Boeing Everett), the planned extension into Downtown Bothell and UW Bothell/Cascadia College, and the broader Community Transit local bus network. Explore how BRT is changing mobility in the SR 527 corridor.

## Streets & Getting Around

### Bike Network
Bothell adopted a Citywide Bike Plan in 2023, acknowledging its transition from a "predominantly motorized vehicle-only suburban community to a multimodal community." Cover the plan's vision, existing infrastructure (Sammamish River Trail, Burke-Gilman Trail connection, North Creek Trail), planned protected bike lanes and neighborhood greenways, gaps in the network, and how bike infrastructure connects to BRT stations.

### Pedestrian Safety & Sidewalks
Bothell has significant sidewalk gaps, especially in neighborhoods annexed from unincorporated county areas. Cover the city's sidewalk inventory, ADA compliance efforts, Safe Routes to School programs, pedestrian crossings on major arterials (SR 522, Bothell Way NE, SR 527), and how the multimodal improvement projects are adding pedestrian infrastructure.

### Sammamish River Trail & Regional Trails
The Sammamish River Trail runs through the heart of Bothell, connecting to the Burke-Gilman Trail and extending to Redmond. Cover the trail network, recent improvements, connections to transit and downtown, the North Creek Trail system, and how trails serve as both recreation and transportation infrastructure.

## Land Use & Development

### Downtown Revitalization
The story of how Bothell transformed its auto-oriented downtown into a walkable mixed-use center through a $150M public investment. Cover the SR 522 realignment, Main Street redesign, Park at Bothell Landing, McMenamins Anderson School, new mixed-use developments, and lessons learned about suburban-to-urban transformation. This is one of Bothell's most compelling urbanism stories.

### Canyon Park
Bothell's other urban center -- a 5.3 square mile area annexed in 1992 that's home to major employers, the future Stride bus base, and the Canyon Park Subarea Plan. Cover the area's history as a tech/biotech hub, current development patterns, the subarea plan, and how BRT stations will reshape the area.

### UW Bothell & Cascadia College Campus Area
How a 130-acre former cattle ranch became a university campus with one of the West Coast's largest wetland restorations. Cover the campus's impact on surrounding development (Beardslee Crossing, Pop Keeney area), student housing demand, the planned Swift Green Line connection, and the campus's role as a community anchor.

### Housing Growth & Middle Housing
Bothell needs 12,782 new homes over the next 20 years, with more than three-quarters affordable. Cover the Imagine Bothell Comprehensive Plan's housing element, HB 1110 and HB 1337 implementation, where new housing is being built, the middle housing code amendments, and the gap between housing targets and current production.

## Infrastructure & Major Projects

### I-405 Corridor Through Bothell
The $834M I-405/Brickyard to SR 527 project is one of the largest highway projects in the region. Cover the express toll lanes, Stride BRT stations, direct access ramps, SR 522 interchange reconstruction, construction impacts, and the debate over highway expansion vs. induced demand.

### Bothell Way NE Multimodal Corridor
A $63M transformation of a 1.3-mile stretch of the former state highway (SR 527) that Bothell took ownership of in 2011. Cover the project scope (wider sidewalks, bike facilities, transit priority, road capacity), the $19M federal grant, connections to the Swift Green Line extension, and the before/after of corridor design.

## Governance & Participation

### Two Counties, One City
Bothell's unique position straddling King County and Snohomish County creates a governance complexity that few residents fully understand. Cover the practical implications: different transit agencies, different county services (libraries, courts, health departments), different tax structures, the county boundary line, and how it affects planning and service delivery.

### How to Participate in Bothell Planning
A practical guide to the city's public participation channels: City Council meetings, Planning Commission, Engage Bothell portal, public comment periods, Design Review Board, and how to read the comprehensive plan. Include tips on effective testimony and where to find meeting agendas and documents.

## Environment & Sustainability

### Parks, Open Space & the Sammamish River
Bothell's parks system, the Sammamish River corridor, wetland areas, and how green infrastructure connects to urban development. Cover Park at Bothell Landing, Blyth Park, North Creek Forest, the UW Bothell wetlands, and how the parks plan intersects with growth targets.

### Climate & Sustainability
Bothell's climate action efforts, tree canopy goals, stormwater management, and how growth management intersects with environmental protection. Cover EV infrastructure, building electrification, and how transit and bike investments contribute to emissions reduction.
