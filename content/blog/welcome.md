# Welcome to the Bothell Urbanism Guide

If you've ever been to a community meeting about a new transit line, housing development, or bike lane and felt like everyone else in the room had context you didn't -- this guide is for you.

## The gap we're trying to fill

Bothell is at a remarkable inflection point. Three BRT lines converging by the early 2030s. A comprehensive plan that fundamentally changes zoning across the city. State housing reforms reshaping what can be built in every neighborhood. An $834 million highway project. A $63 million multimodal corridor redesign.

But following all this requires understanding how the city is governed, what the acronyms mean, and what decisions led to the current moment. If you're new to Bothell or new to caring about urban issues, there's a steep learning curve before you can even follow the conversation.

This guide is that missing baseline. It's a **reference**, not a news source. The goal is to give you enough context that when you attend a City Council meeting or a Sound Transit open house, you can engage meaningfully.
