# Bothell Quick Start

You want to understand what's going on with urban development in Bothell. Here's the big picture -- enough context to follow the news, understand the debates, and show up informed to community meetings.

## The basics: how Bothell is governed

Bothell uses a **council-manager** form of government. The [City Council](https://www.bothellwa.gov/261/City-Council), made up of seven members elected at-large to staggered four-year terms, sets policy and approves the budget. The **Mayor** is selected by the council (not directly elected) and serves a ceremonial role presiding at meetings. A professional **City Manager** handles day-to-day administration and runs city departments.

Most of the urbanist action happens through a handful of key departments. The **[Community Development Department](https://www.bothellwa.gov/300/Community-Development)** handles planning, zoning, and building permits. **[Public Works](https://www.bothellwa.gov/149/Departments)** manages streets, utilities, and capital projects. The **[Planning Commission](https://www.bothellwa.gov/274/Planning-Commission)** advises on comprehensive plan amendments and zoning code changes, meeting the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays at 6 PM.

One unique thing about Bothell: the city straddles **both King County and Snohomish County**. The county boundary runs along NE 205th Street / 244th Street SW. Downtown Bothell is in King County; Canyon Park and the northern areas are in Snohomish County. This means residents deal with different county agencies depending on where they live.

Transit in Bothell involves three separate agencies. **[Sound Transit](https://www.soundtransit.org/)** is building Stride BRT along SR 522 and I-405. **[Community Transit](https://www.communitytransit.org/)** operates the Swift Green Line BRT and local bus service in the Snohomish County portion. **[King County Metro](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro)** provides bus service in the King County portion.

## The big picture: Bothell's growth story

Bothell has grown from a small suburban town to a city of over 50,000, shaped by several intersecting forces.

The 1992 Canyon Park annexation doubled the city's size, adding 5.3 square miles of Snohomish County land and making Bothell one of the county's largest employment centers. The opening of the **UW Bothell and Cascadia College campus** in 2000 on a 130-acre former ranch brought thousands of students and catalyzed surrounding development. A massive **$150 million downtown revitalization program** beginning in 2010 transformed Bothell's auto-oriented core into a walkable mixed-use center with a redesigned Main Street, new housing, and trail connections.

At the state level, the **Growth Management Act of 1990** requires growth within urban boundaries rather than sprawling outward. Washington's recent housing reforms -- **HB 1110** (middle housing), **HB 1337** (ADU reform), and **HB 1491** (transit-oriented development) -- are pushing Bothell to allow more housing types across the city.

The result is a city transitioning from a predominantly car-dependent suburb to a multimodal community, wrestling with how to grow equitably and how to move people without everyone driving.

## What's happening right now

### Imagine Bothell Comprehensive Plan (2024)

On December 10, 2024, the Bothell City Council approved the **Imagine Bothell Comprehensive Plan** periodic update -- the most significant planning action in years. The plan identifies a need for **12,782 new homes** over the next 20 years, with more than three-quarters needing to be affordable to people earning less than the area median income. Key changes include allowing smaller lot sizes, more units per lot, and permitting townhouses, multiplexes, and smaller apartment buildings in neighborhoods across the city. The plan also increases density and building heights in mixed-use zones.

### Stride BRT (Sound Transit)

Sound Transit's **Stride S3 line** will run 8 miles with 14 stations from Shoreline South/148th Link light rail station to Bothell along SR 522, with 60-foot battery-electric buses running every 10-15 minutes. Anticipated travel time from Bothell to the Shoreline South Link station: just 22 minutes. Target opening: 2028. The **S2 line** along I-405 will also connect at the future Bothell/Woodinville Transit Center. Sound Transit broke ground on a new **$274 million electric bus operations and maintenance facility** in Canyon Park in 2025.

### Swift Green Line Extension (Community Transit)

Community Transit plans to extend the **Swift Green Line** BRT from Canyon Park south into Downtown Bothell and the UW Bothell/Cascadia College campus, adding up to 6 new stations. Target: 2031. This extension will connect with Stride S3, creating a multimodal transit hub.

### I-405/Brickyard to SR 527 Project

A massive **$834 million WSDOT project** is adding express toll lanes, new Stride BRT stations, direct access ramps, and reconstructing the SR 522 interchange through 4.5 miles of I-405 in Bothell. Completion expected spring 2028.

### Middle housing and ADU reforms

State mandates HB 1110 and HB 1337 require Bothell to allow duplexes on all residential lots, permit at least two ADUs per lot, increase ADU size limits, and remove owner-occupancy requirements. Bothell has adopted code amendments implementing these changes.

### Bothell Way NE Multimodal Improvements

A **$63 million** overhaul of a 1.3-mile segment of Bothell Way NE is increasing capacity for driving, walking, biking, and transit. The project supports the future Swift Green Line extension and was funded in part by a $19 million federal grant.

## How to get involved

### Attending meetings

Several venues exist for public participation. **City Council meetings** have public comment periods -- agendas are posted on [bothellwa.gov](https://www.bothellwa.gov/261/City-Council). The **Planning Commission** meets the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays at 6 PM and reviews comprehensive plan and zoning code amendments. Sound Transit and Community Transit hold open houses for BRT projects. The city's **[Engage Bothell](https://engagebothell.com/)** portal is used for public input on major planning initiatives.

### Tracking what's going on

[The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/) covers Bothell urbanism in depth, including downtown transformation, Stride BRT, and the comprehensive plan. [Engage Bothell](https://engagebothell.com/) posts updates on city planning projects. The [Bothell-Kenmore Reporter](https://www.bothell-reporter.com/) covers local news.

### Making your voice heard

Most city processes have formal comment periods, and written comments count -- you don't always need to show up in person. Contacting your councilmembers directly can be effective, especially on land use issues. Joining a local advocacy organization that aligns with your goals amplifies your voice. Check with groups like **[Our Bothell, Our Future](https://ourbothellourfuture.org/)** to find organized advocacy efforts.
