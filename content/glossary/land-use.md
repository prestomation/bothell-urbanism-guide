# Land Use & Planning Terms

## Comprehensive Plan

A city's long-range plan for growth, land use, transportation, parks, and utilities. Required by Washington's Growth Management Act. Bothell's comprehensive plan ("Imagine Bothell") was updated in December 2024 and guides zoning and investment decisions for 20+ years.

**Why it matters:** The comprehensive plan is the single most important policy document for Bothell's future. The 2024 update plans for 12,782 new homes, allows more density citywide, and reshapes how the city approaches growth. Understanding the comp plan helps you follow virtually every land use debate.

## Concurrency

A Growth Management Act requirement that infrastructure (roads, water, sewer, schools) must be adequate to serve new development at the time it's built -- or within a set timeframe. Development can be denied if infrastructure isn't available.

**Why it matters:** Concurrency requirements can be used to block or delay housing projects if cities claim infrastructure is insufficient. Reform advocates argue concurrency has been weaponized to prevent density. The GMA has been updated to prevent concurrency from being used as a de facto growth moratorium.

## Downtown Subarea Plan

A focused planning document that sets the vision for a specific area of the city. Bothell is working on an updated Downtown Subarea Plan to create a new future vision for downtown including buildings, transportation, public spaces, and the local economy.

**Why it matters:** Subarea plans translate the broad policies of the comprehensive plan into specific development standards for a neighborhood. The Downtown Subarea Plan will determine building heights, setbacks, uses, and design standards for the heart of Bothell -- shaping what gets built there for years to come.

## EIS (Environmental Impact Statement)

A detailed study of a project's or plan's environmental effects, required under SEPA for major actions. Covers traffic, noise, environmental damage, and more.

**Why it matters:** EIS processes can add years and millions of dollars to projects. They're an important environmental protection but also get used strategically to delay development or infrastructure. Understanding when an EIS is required helps you follow major project timelines.

## GMA (Growth Management Act)

Washington state law (1990) requiring urban areas to plan for growth, protect rural land, and provide infrastructure. Mandates comprehensive plans, urban growth boundaries, and periodic updates.

**Why it matters:** The GMA is *why* Bothell must plan for growth rather than sprawling indefinitely. It's the legal framework behind comprehensive plans, urban growth boundaries, and concurrency requirements. Bothell's 2024 comprehensive plan update was required by the GMA's periodic update schedule.

## Middle Housing Model Ordinance

A state-created zoning code developed by the Washington Department of Commerce that automatically supersedes local regulations if cities fail to comply with HB 1110's middle housing requirements by their deadline. The model ordinance establishes development standards for duplexes through sixplexes, townhouses, courtyard apartments, cottage housing, and stacked flats.

**Why it matters:** The model ordinance acts as a "default" code that creates a floor for housing capacity statewide. If Bothell hadn't adopted compliant regulations, Commerce's model code would have automatically taken effect. This dynamic -- where the state's backstop code can be more permissive than local proposals -- shaped negotiations between the city and housing advocates during the comp plan process.

## PSRC (Puget Sound Regional Council)

The regional planning and transportation organization for the four-county central Puget Sound area (King, Snohomish, Pierce, Kitsap). PSRC certifies that local comprehensive plans conform to regional growth strategies and allocates federal transportation funding.

**Why it matters:** PSRC certified Bothell's 2024 comprehensive plan as consistent with regional planning policies. PSRC also allocates federal transportation funding and coordinates regional growth targets that determine how much housing each city must plan for.

## SEPA (State Environmental Policy Act)

Washington's environmental review law. Requires government agencies to evaluate environmental impacts before approving projects, plans, or permits.

**Why it matters:** SEPA review is a common step in development and planning that can significantly affect timelines. It's also a tool that community members can use to raise concerns about projects. Knowing what SEPA covers helps you participate meaningfully in public comment periods.

## Urban Growth Boundary (UGB)

A line on the map separating urban areas (where growth is directed) from rural areas (which are preserved). King County and Snohomish County each maintain UGBs that limit sprawl and concentrate development.

**Why it matters:** Because Bothell straddles two counties, it interacts with two different urban growth boundaries. The UGB directs growth into urban areas rather than allowing outward sprawl, which directly shapes the density debates within the city. Bothell has four planning subareas that include portions of the urban growth area outside current city limits.

---

## Zoning

Government rules that dictate what can be built where -- building height, density, use (residential, commercial, industrial), setbacks, lot coverage, etc.

**Why it matters:** Zoning is the fundamental tool that shapes what Bothell looks like. Almost every land use debate comes down to zoning. The 2024 comprehensive plan update includes significant zoning changes -- increased density in mixed-use zones, middle housing allowed in residential zones, and new development standards near transit.
