# Bothell Urbanism Guide

**A practical guide for people who want to make Bothell a better place to live, move, and grow.**

Bothell is changing fast. New BRT lines, zoning reforms, bike infrastructure, housing policy -- there's a lot happening, and it can be hard to know where to start. This guide exists so that when you show up to a city council meeting, open house, or public comment period, you can actually follow the conversation and contribute meaningfully.

- You care about housing, transit, or walkability but feel lost in the jargon
