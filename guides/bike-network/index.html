Owned and maintained by <a href=https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dnrp/nature-recreation/parks-recreation/king-county-parks/trails/leafline-trails/sammamish-river-trail>King County Parks</a>, it opened in 1979 on a levee left from a 1960s Army Corps of Engineers flood-control project. The trail is ADA accessible except for two short sections with grades below standards.</p><p>Within Bothell, the trail connects Blyth Park to <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/1007/Park-at-Bothell-Landing>Park at Bothell Landing</a> and downtown, then continues south toward the UW Bothell/Cascadia College campus. Access points in Bothell include Blyth Park and Bothell Landing.</p><h3 id=burke-gilman-trail>Burke-Gilman Trail<a class=anchor href=#burke-gilman-trail>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke%E2%80%93Gilman_Trail>Burke-Gilman Trail</a> runs approximately 18.8 miles from Golden Gardens Park in Seattle to Blyth Park in Bothell, where it connects to the Sammamish River Trail. Together, the two trails form a 27-mile corridor from Seattle to Redmond that is part of the <a href=https://www.railstotrails.org/greatamericanrailtrail/>Great American Rail-Trail</a>, a planned 3,700-mile route connecting Washington, D.C. to Washington State.</p><h3 id=north-creek-trail>North Creek Trail<a class=anchor href=#north-creek-trail>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/894/North-Creek-Trail-Section-4>North Creek Trail</a> runs north-south through eastern Bothell, connecting the Sammamish River Trail to Snohomish County&rsquo;s trail network. Within Bothell, the trail is 10 feet wide and paved, passing through the Canyon Park wetlands with views of eagles, hawks, and waterfowl. When fully connected, the trail will link the Burke-Gilman/Sammamish River Trail system in King County to the <a href=https://snohomishcountywa.gov/680/North-Creek-Regional-Trail---Mill-Creek->Interurban Trail</a> in south Everett.</p><p><strong>North Creek Trail Section 4</strong>, the last missing segment within Bothell city limits, was completed in 2024. The <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/894/North-Creek-Trail-Section-4>$7.5 million project</a> built 0.58 miles of separated paved trail along 208th Street SE, including a pedestrian bridge, structural earth wall, wider culverts, and wetland mitigation. A <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/894/North-Creek-Trail-Section-4>ribbon-cutting ceremony</a> was held on September 17, 2024.</p><p>North of Bothell, <a href=https://snohomishcountywa.gov/680/North-Creek-Regional-Trail---Mill-Creek->Snohomish County</a> is building additional segments at an estimated total cost of $22.8 million across three phases. Phase I (SR 524 to Sprague Drive, $7.1 million) was completed in fall 2022. Phase II ($7.6 million) and Phase III ($8.1 million, including a quarter-mile elevated bridge) are in design and seeking funding.</p><h2 id=on-street-bike-facilities>On-street bike facilities<a class=anchor href=#on-street-bike-facilities>#</a></h2><h3 id=existing-facilities>Existing facilities<a class=anchor href=#existing-facilities>#</a></h3><p>Bothell&rsquo;s on-street bike network is limited.

Some facilities are disconnected, creating gaps that force cyclists onto streets without any bike infrastructure.</p><h3 id=citywide-bike-plan-2023>Citywide Bike Plan (2023)<a class=anchor href=#citywide-bike-plan-2023>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/16168/Bike-Plan>Bothell Citywide Bike Plan</a> was finalized in November 2022 and <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/1415/Bike-Plan>adopted by City Council on April 4, 2023</a>. The plan identifies a long-term vision for a connected network of on-street bike facilities linking neighborhoods to regional trails, transit stops, schools, and commercial centers.</p><p>Key elements of the plan:</p><ul><li><strong>Three facility types</strong>: protected bike lanes, shared-use paths, and sharrow lanes, with <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/1415/Bike-Plan>design standards</a> for each</li><li><strong>Priority corridors</strong>: Bothell Way NE / Bothell-Everett Highway / 9th Avenue SE and 228th Street SE/SW are identified as the main on-street bike corridors</li><li><strong>Trail gap closures</strong>: Completing missing segments of the North Creek Trail and improving connections between regional trails and on-street facilities</li><li><strong>Grant competitiveness</strong>: Having an adopted plan makes the city more competitive for regional, state, and federal transportation grants</li></ul><p>The plan&rsquo;s full buildout vision would cost several hundred million dollars and is acknowledged as a long-term aspiration rather than a near-term commitment. Implementation depends on integrating bike facilities into capital projects as streets are rebuilt or widened.</p><h2 id=major-projects-with-bike-facilities>Major projects with bike facilities<a class=anchor href=#major-projects-with-bike-facilities>#</a></h2><h3 id=bothell-way-ne-multimodal-improvements>Bothell Way NE Multimodal Improvements<a class=anchor href=#bothell-way-ne-multimodal-improvements>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=https://bothellwa.gov/1925/Bothell-Way-NE-Multimodal-Improvements-P>Bothell Way NE Multimodal Improvements Project</a> is the most significant current investment in Bothell&rsquo;s on-street bike infrastructure.
