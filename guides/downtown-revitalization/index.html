The highway created a barrier between Main Street and the Sammamish River, and the surrounding area was characterized by strip malls, surface parking lots, and auto-oriented businesses.</p><h3 id=2006-2009-planning-phase>2006-2009: Planning phase<a class=anchor href=#2006-2009-planning-phase>#</a></h3><p>Planning for the downtown transformation began in 2006. The city developed a <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/323/Downtown-Subarea-Plan-Regulations>Downtown Subarea Plan</a> adopted in 2009, establishing the framework for the revitalization. The city purchased the former Anderson School for redevelopment in 2009 and sold it to McMenamins in 2010.</p><h3 id=2010-construction-begins>2010: Construction begins<a class=anchor href=#2010-construction-begins>#</a></h3><p>Construction launched on the <a href=https://www.atkn.com/our-work/projects/bothell-crossroads>Bothell Crossroads project</a>, a <a href=https://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/construction-ramping-up-on-bothell-crossroads-project-open-house-set-for-may-24/>$55.4 million SR 522 realignment</a> that moved the highway one block south. The new alignment created two travel lanes in each direction with left turn lanes, sidewalks separated from traffic by tree-lined planters, and landscaped medians. Three new intersections at NE 180th Street, 98th Avenue NE, and SR 527 gave pedestrians new connections between downtown and the park.</p><p>The project also installed a precast box culvert beneath the new SR 522 alignment for the future re-channeling of Horse Creek, sealed at both ends and filled with streambed gravel so a future contractor could extend it without disrupting the highway.</p><h3 id=2011-bothell-way-ne-transferred-to-city>2011: Bothell Way NE transferred to city<a class=anchor href=#2011-bothell-way-ne-transferred-to-city>#</a></h3><p>SR 527 south of I-405 was <a href=https://bothellwa.gov/1925/Bothell-Way-NE-Multimodal-Improvements-P>decommissioned as a state highway</a> and transferred to Bothell, becoming Bothell Way NE.

The new <a href=https://millerhull.com/project/bothell-city-hall-civic-center/>Bothell City Hall</a> opened in October 2015, consolidating city departments into a single downtown building. McMenamins Anderson School opened its 72-room hotel, brewery, and entertainment complex in the renovated <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_School_%28Bothell,_Washington%29>1931 school building</a>, designed by Seattle architect Earl W.

The state provided $4.7 million in aid for recovery. The fire accelerated changes already underway in downtown&rsquo;s commercial landscape and ultimately led to the Mercantile redevelopment with 122 apartment homes on Main Street.</p><h3 id=2017-2018-main-street-enhancement>2017-2018: Main Street Enhancement<a class=anchor href=#2017-2018-main-street-enhancement>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/1306/Main-Street-Enhancement-Project-Facts>$5.9 million Main Street Enhancement Project</a> rebuilt two blocks (approximately 1,000 feet) of Main Street with a curbless shared-street design. Funded by a $4.7 million state grant and a $1.03 million federal FHWA grant plus local funds, the project ran from April 2017 to April 2018. The design features 80 adjustable bollards, 27 parking stalls with flex zones, and the ability to close the street for events.</p><h3 id=2019-present-private-development-wave>2019-present: Private development wave<a class=anchor href=#2019-present-private-development-wave>#</a></h3><p>Mixed-use developments began opening along Bothell Way NE, including Six Oaks, The Junction, and The POP Apartments. The Alexan Main Street, a <a href=https://www.grahambuilds.com/alexan-bothell-apartments-multi-key-mixed-use/>369-unit, six-story building</a> at the intersection of Bothell Way NE and SR 522, became the most prominent new development in the area.</p><h2 id=how-the-city-managed-the-revitalization>How the city managed the revitalization<a class=anchor href=#how-the-city-managed-the-revitalization>#</a></h2><h3 id=funding-strategy>Funding strategy<a class=anchor href=#funding-strategy>#</a></h3><p>The city assembled funding from multiple sources over the life of the program, combining federal and state grants, innovative state financing tools, and local funds to reach over <a href=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/bothell-breaks-ground-on-a-grand-plan-to-fix-its-downtown/>$150 million in public investment</a>. Key funding mechanisms included:</p><ul><li><strong>Federal grants</strong> &ndash; FHWA grants for design and construction of street improvements</li><li><strong>State grants</strong> &ndash; Including $4.7 million for Main Street recovery after the 2016 fire</li><li><strong>LIFT (Local Infrastructure Financing Tool)</strong> &ndash; A <a href=https://mrsc.org/explore-topics/finance/revenues/tax-increment-financing>state program</a> allowing cities to capture a portion of increased tax revenue from redevelopment areas to fund infrastructure</li><li><strong>Brightwater mitigation funds</strong> &ndash; From King County&rsquo;s Brightwater Treatment Plant project</li><li><strong>Local funds</strong> &ndash; City matching funds and bond proceeds</li></ul><h3 id=land-assembly>Land assembly<a class=anchor href=#land-assembly>#</a></h3><p>The city acquired approximately <a href=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/bothell-breaks-ground-on-a-grand-plan-to-fix-its-downtown/>26 acres of land</a> in the downtown core to enable the transformation. After completing infrastructure, the city sold 20 acres for private development, generating revenue while ensuring developments aligned with the subarea plan&rsquo;s vision.</p><h3 id=the-2009-downtown-subarea-plan>The 2009 Downtown Subarea Plan<a class=anchor href=#the-2009-downtown-subarea-plan>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/323/Downtown-Subarea-Plan-Regulations>Downtown Subarea Plan and Regulations</a> adopted in 2009 provided the planning framework. It established zoning for mixed-use development, design standards, and infrastructure priorities. The plan is codified in <a href=https://www.bothellwa.gov/323/Downtown-Subarea-Plan-Regulations>BMC 12.64</a> and includes a comprehensive plan element, development regulations, and appendices documenting existing conditions and community engagement.</p><h3 id=downtown-subarea-plan-update-in-progress>Downtown Subarea Plan Update (in progress)<a class=anchor href=#downtown-subarea-plan-update-in-progress>#</a></h3><p>The city is now undertaking a <a href=https://engagebothell.com/projects/downtown-subarea-plan-update/events>Downtown Subarea Plan Update</a> to reflect the substantial changes of the past 15 years. The update will create a new vision for downtown&rsquo;s buildings, transportation system, public spaces, and economy for the next 20 years.
